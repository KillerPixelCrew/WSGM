# Provenance

Everything in this package was built without an Ally on the desk. Every device fact comes from one of
the references below, and none has a recorded hardware pass yet. The maintainer's direction for this
package: HHD is the authority for buttons, the Handheld Companion Patreon build is the authority for
everything else, and each disagreement between them is written down here.

## Identity

| Fact                                                  | Source                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Manufacturer `ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC.`, baseboard product RC71L, RC72LA, RC73YA, RC73XA | HC `HandheldCompanion.Devices/IDevice.cs:1027-1046` (`MotherboardInfo.Product`)            |
| RC72L admitted for the Ally X                         | HHD `adjustor/core/const.py:339` (`ROG Ally X RC72L`); the earlier scaffold manifest        |
| Model split: Ally, Ally X, Xbox Ally, Xbox Ally X     | HHD `hhd/device/rog_ally/__init__.py:116-142`; HC classes `ROGAlly`, `ROGAllyX`, `XboxROGAlly`, `XboxROGAllyX` |
| Controller USB IDs 0B05:1ABE and 0B05:1B4C            | HC `ROGAlly.cs:212-213`; HHD `rog_ally/base.py:29-30`                                        |

HHD matches the DMI product name by substring; HC and this package match the baseboard product
exactly. The Xbox models' SMBIOS SKU was empty in the lab run, so the SKU is not part of the gate.

## Controller

| Fact                                                             | Source                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The pad is read through XInput on every model                    | HC `HandheldCompanion.Managers/ControllerManager.cs:2236-2243` (0B05 XUSB becomes `XboxAdaptiveController : XInputController`) |
| Guide bit through `XInputGetStateEx` (xinput1_4 ordinal 100)      | HC `HandheldCompanion.Controllers/XInputController.cs:232, 376-377`     |
| Slot identity through `XInputGetCapabilitiesEx` (ordinal 108)     | HC `XInputController.cs:53-89, 370-371`                                 |
| Rumble through `XInputSetState`, large motor left                | HC `XInputController.cs:279-296`                                        |
| Windows.Gaming.Input fallback when no XInput slot exists         | The RC73XA lab run found no XInput slot; the Ally X Lab's third motor route (`tools/AllyXLab/Motors.cs`, deleted since) |
| Vendor collection FF31:0080, report 0x5A                         | HHD `rog_ally/base.py:383-393`; HC finds it by feature report 0x5A (`ROGAlly.cs:416-436`) |
| Controller tables (game mode, button pairs, triggers, commit)    | HHD `rog_ally/const.py:62-1132` (`COMMANDS_GAME`); byte-identical to HC `ROGAlly.cs:93-183` |
| Tables sent as 64-byte feature reports                           | HC `ROGAlly.cs:646-668` (`WriteFeatureReport(..., 64)`)                  |
| Tables restored with the factory M1/M2 block on release          | HC `ROGAlly.cs:396-400` (`ConfigureController(Remap: false)`); block from HHD `const.py:839-896` |

Disagreements:

- HHD writes the tables as HID output reports (`hid.py:357-372`), HC as feature reports. The RC73XA
  run found no output report on FF31:0080, so feature reports are used.
- Commit values: HC sends vibration 100/100 and stick and trigger ranges 0-100 (`ROGAlly.cs:177-183`);
  HHD sends vibration 50 on the Ally X family and outer limits of 0x40 or 0x60
  (`rog_ally/base.py:44-51`, `const.py:1073-1118`). HC's values are used.
- HHD re-sends the tables after five seconds in case the MCU missed them (`base.py:164-171`). An
  uncertain write is never retried here.
- HHD writes rumble as the HID output report `0D 0F 00 00 weak strong FF 00 EB` (`base.py:226-254`);
  HC uses XInput. HC is used.

## Buttons

| Fact                                                                 | Source                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 0xA6 is the guide ("mode"), 0x38 and 0x93 the QAM ("keyboard")       | HHD `rog_ally/base.py:180-196`                    |
| 0xA7 is the right button's hold, 0xA8 its release (ignored)          | HHD `rog_ally/base.py:198-215`                    |
| Release-less events are held for 150 ms                             | HHD `rog_ally/base.py:53` (`MODE_DELAY`)          |
| M1/M2 become keyboard keys only after the M1/M2 table is written     | HHD `const.py:897-954` (`REMAP_M1M2_F17F18`), `base.py:396-403` |
| Left rear button sends F18, right sends F17                          | Device Lab RC73XA run, results 019 and 020 (VK 0x81 and 0x80) |
| Xbox models' front buttons arrived as F21 (left) and F22 (right)     | Device Lab RC73XA run, results 017 and 018        |
| Xbox button goes to QAM, the 0xA6 button to the guide                | HHD `rog_ally/base.py:415-427` (`share_to_qam=True`) and `controllers.yml` (`swap_xbox`) |
| Xbox models' left button is Armoury Crate, right is Library          | glyph theme `themes/asus/rog-xbox-ally.css`; HC maps 0x93 to Library (`ROGAlly.cs:63-66`) |

Disagreements:

- HC maps 0x93 to a separate Library button (OEM5) and 0xA7/0xA8 to M2 as press and release
  (`ROGAlly.cs:53-83, 485-505`). HHD, the button authority, merges 0x93 into the QAM and treats 0xA7
  as the right button's hold. HHD is followed.
- HHD maps F17 to the left extra button and F18 to the right (`base.py:396-403`); HC labels F18 as M1
  (`ROGAlly.cs:263-282`). The lab run saw the left button send F18, agreeing with HC, so the lab
  result is used and HHD's assignment is recorded as the likely error.
- The glyph theme labels the left rear button M2 (`themes/asus/rog-ally.css`, `--button-l4-image`).
  This package labels left M1, following HC and the lab wizard. The physical print is unverified.

## Motion

| Fact                                                                 | Source                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| WinRT `Gyrometer`/`Accelerometer` first, legacy Sensor API second     | HC `HandheldCompanion.Devices/IDevice.cs:1152-1172`      |
| Standard legacy fields, format 3F8A69A2..., PIDs 2-4 and 10-12        | HC `HandheldCompanion.Sensors/WindowsSensorManager.cs:96-114` |
| Axis swap `{X: X, Y: Z, Z: Y}`, Ally and Ally X signs (-1, -1, 1)     | HC `Resources/Devices/ROGAlly.json`, `ROGAllyX.json`     |
| Xbox models: gyro signs (1, 1, -1), accelerometer (-1, -1, 1)         | HC `Resources/Devices/XboxROGAlly.json`, `XboxROGAllyX.json` |
| HC's matrix output equals WSGM's motion basis                         | HC `ClawA2VM.json` gives `(raw X, raw Z, -raw Y)`, the Claw plugin's measured basis |

Disagreements: HHD maps all four models with one transform, `(x, z, -y)` for both sensors
(`rog_ally/base.py:34-42`), and reads the IIO device directly with its own scale. HC is used, and its
Xbox gyro signs differ from its accelerometer signs, which a single IMU would not normally need; the
lab report must settle it. The stationary gyro-offset correction is the Claw's, with thresholds
measured on the Claw's LSM6DSO.

## Power

| Fact                                                                 | Source                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\\.\ATKACPI`, IOCTL 0x0022240C, DSTS/DEVS layout                     | HC `HandheldCompanion.Devices.ASUS/AsusACPI.cs:11-51, 110-188` |
| SPL 0x001200A3, SPPT 0x001200A0, FPPT 0x001200C1                      | HC `AsusACPI.cs:45-49`                                   |
| Long limit writes SPL; short limit writes SPPT and FPPT together     | HC `AsusACPI.cs:343-352`                                 |
| Performance mode 0x00120075: 0 performance, 1 turbo, 2 silent         | HC `AsusACPI.cs:51` and `ROGAlly.cs:229-259` (`OEMPowerMode`); HHD `adjustor/drivers/asus/__init__.py:296-303` |
| Write order keeping SPL <= SPPT <= FPPT                              | Ally X Lab `AsusControl.Restore`; HHD writes fast, slow, steady (`__init__.py:384-389`) |
| 100 ms between limit writes, 150 ms after a mode change              | HHD `__init__.py:14` (`TDP_DELAY`); Ally X Lab           |
| DSTS scalar presence bit 0x10000                                     | HC `AsusACPI.cs:182-188` (`DeviceGet` returns raw - 65536) |
| Watt ranges: Ally and Ally X 5-30, Xbox models 5-35                   | HC `ROGAlly.cs:215`, `XboxROGAlly.cs:14`, `XboxROGAllyX.cs:14`; HHD `adjustor/core/const.py:261-320` |
| Presets Silent/Performance/Turbo 10/15/25 W (Ally), 13/17/25 W (others) | HC `ROGAlly.cs:229-259`, `ROGAllyX.cs:13-27`, `XboxROGAlly.cs:17-31`, `XboxROGAllyX.cs:17-31` |

Disagreements:

- HC's Xbox Ally range is 15-35 W, but its own Silent preset is 13 W; HHD gives the Xbox Ally
  4-20 W (OC 25). The minimum is lowered to 5 so HC's presets validate, and HC's 35 W maximum is kept.
- HHD's performance preset is 30 W on AC and 25 W on battery for the Ally and Ally X; HC uses 25 W.
  HC is used.
- HC never reads the limits back. Readback through DSTS is from the Ally X Lab and is unverified;
  when it does not report, commands return unverified and nothing can be journalled.

## Fans and charging

| Fact                                                          | Source                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Curve IDs CPU 0x00110024, GPU 0x00110025, mid 0x00110032       | HC `AsusACPI.cs:31-35`                                    |
| Sixteen bytes, eight temperatures then eight duties, duty <= 99 | HC `AsusACPI.cs:281-298`, `ROGAlly.cs:287-311`             |
| Same curve on every fan                                       | HC `ROGAlly.cs:313-327`                                   |
| Automatic writes HC's default tables                          | HC `ROGAlly.cs:185-195, 466-478`                          |
| Curve readback selector by performance mode                   | HC `AsusACPI.cs:300-314`                                  |
| Fan readings 0x00110013 and 0x00110014, read as duty          | HC `AsusACPI.cs:39-41, 316-333`                           |
| Charge limit 0x00120057                                       | HC `AsusACPI.cs:37, 335-341`                              |

Disagreements: HHD drives two fans through Linux hwmon with fixed temperature points 30-100 °C and a
0-255 duty (`__init__.py:46-48, 90-113`); HC's ATKACPI curve is used. When the plugin has captured
the original curves it writes those back for "automatic" instead of HC's fixed defaults. The charge
limit is offered from 40 %, not HC's 0.

## Lighting

| Fact                                                                   | Source                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Aura collection found by feature report 0x5D                           | HC `ROGAlly.cs:416-436`                        |
| Brightness `5D BA C5 C4 level` as a feature report, level = percent / 33.33 | HC `ROGAlly.cs:507-522`                    |
| Colour message, apply `5D B4`, set `5D B5` as output reports            | HC `ROGAlly.cs:556-617`                        |
| Effects solid 0, breathing 1, colour cycle 2, rainbow 3; zones 0-4      | HC `ROGAlly.cs:22-51`; HHD `hid.py:41-130`     |
| Speed bytes and HC's bands (33/66)                                     | HC `ROGAlly.cs:31-36, 552`                     |
| Per-zone solid colours for the two rings                               | HC `ROGAlly.cs:575-593` (`ApplyColorFast`)     |
| Xbox models: lamp array to autonomous mode (`06 01`)                    | HHD `rog_ally/base.py:482-505`                 |

Disagreements:

- HHD sends Aura as report 0x5A on the vendor collection, with an "ASUS Tech.Inc." handshake first
  (`const.py:1151-1177`); HC uses report 0x5D without a handshake. HC is used.
- Speed: HC calls 0xEB slow, 0xF5 medium and 0xE1 fast; HHD calls 0xE1 low and 0xF5 high
  (`hid.py:92-100`). HC is used.
- The lamp array step is HHD's only; HC does nothing special on the Xbox models. It is sent once per
  cycle as a feature report and never retried.

## Glyphs

Two profiles from handheld-controller-glyphs: `rog-ally` for RC71L and RC72LA with the
`asus/rog-ally` artwork, and `rog-xbox-ally` for RC73YA and RC73XA with `asus/rog-xbox-ally`. Guide
and QAM follow `themes/asus/rog-ally.css` and `themes/asus/rog-xbox-ally.css`. All ASUS assets are
shipped, including the mono face buttons and the alternate rear-button marks, unmodified. No
highlight overlays are declared: their coordinates would be guesses.

## What the Device Lab report must confirm

1. SMBIOS baseboard manufacturer and product on each model, and the controller's USB product ID.
2. That the pad has an XInput slot reporting VID 0B05 through `XInputGetCapabilitiesEx`, or on the
   Xbox models that Windows.Gaming.Input sees it; and which XUSB, GIP or HID nodes must be hidden.
3. That the guide bit reports the Xbox button on the Xbox models, and nothing on the others.
4. Which vendor codes each front button sends (0xA6, 0x38, 0x93, 0xA7, 0xA8) after the tables are
   written, and whether the Xbox models then still send F21/F22.
5. That the feature-report controller tables are accepted, which rear button sends F17 and F18, and
   the physical M1/M2 print on each side.
6. That writing the factory tables returns the rear buttons to their stock behaviour.
7. Rumble strength through XInput, and whether 100/100 vibration intensity is too strong on the
   Ally X family as HHD claims.
8. Gyro and accelerometer axis signs per model, and whether WinRT or the legacy API delivers them.
9. Whether DSTS reports SPL, SPPT, FPPT and the performance mode, and whether a mode change resets
   the limits.
10. The real watt envelope per model, especially the Xbox Ally.
11. Whether a DSTS curve read returns the curve in force or the factory table for the mode, whether
    the mid fan exists, and what unit the fan readings use.
12. The charge-limit range the firmware accepts, and whether DSTS reads it back.
13. That the Aura collection answers 0x5D on every model, the speed byte order, and whether the Xbox
    models need the lamp-array step.
