///         Correction is plain subtraction: no deadband and no zero-hold, so sensor noise stays continuous
///         and every rate a target integrates is the rate the die reported. The offset is measured from
///         rest windows recognized by three device-derived gates, whose thresholds come from stationary
///         captures taken on the reference unit — see "This part's gyroscope has a zero-rate offset" in the
///         plugin README for the measured numbers.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         A steady yaw is the one motion no acceleration gate can distinguish from rest, so a device that
///         starts up already turning slowly — on a train or in a car — can measure that turn as its offset.
///         That is unavoidable without an external heading reference, so the design makes it survivable
///         instead: the magnitude limit bounds how wrong the value can be, and a run of agreeing windows
///         re-acquires. A single clamp on refinement would instead freeze the wrong value for the whole
///         device cycle, because the honest windows that follow are exactly the ones a clamp rejects.
